# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## SEO & Accessibility

This project has been systematically upgraded to meet high industry standards for SEO and accessibility. Key improvements include:

- **Meta Tags & Head Elements:** Unique titles, descriptions, robots, Open Graph, Twitter Card, and keywords for all main pages using `react-helmet-async`.
- **Structured Data:** JSON-LD Organization schema on the landing page and Service schema on all service pages for enhanced search visibility.
- **Canonical URLs:** All main pages include canonical tags to prevent duplicate content issues.
- **Sitemap & Robots.txt:** `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are present in `/public` for search engine crawling.
- **Semantic HTML & ARIA:** All main components use semantic elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) and ARIA attributes for improved accessibility.
- **Headings & Alt Text:** Each page has a single `<h1>`, logical heading structure, and descriptive `alt` attributes for all images.
- **Image Performance:** Major images use `loading="lazy"` for faster page loads.
- **Responsive Design:** CSS media queries and viewport meta tag ensure mobile-friendliness.
- **Clean URLs:** All routes use descriptive, human-readable URLs.

### Recommendations
- **Content:** Ensure all pages have unique, relevant content and internal links.
- **Analytics:** Integrate Google Analytics or similar for traffic monitoring.
- **Search Console:** Set up Google Search Console for indexing and performance insights.
- **Accessibility:** Periodically review for WCAG compliance and test with screen readers.
- **Performance:** Consider code splitting and critical CSS for further optimization.
- **Structured Data Validation:** Use Googleâ€™s Rich Results Test to validate JSON-LD.
